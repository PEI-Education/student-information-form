# Student Information Form
This PowerSchool plug-in adds a web report version of the Student Information Form to the system. Built with HandlebarsJS and Webpack.

# To Access the Form
1. Make a selection of students
2. Group the Group Functions menu or the System Reports page, select Student Information Report.

## Installing th repo
*Note: these are not the instructions for installing a plugin in PowerSchool. These are the instructions for installing the repo on your local machine for development purposes.

Clone this repo and npm install (note: unless you have admin rights, an EUS Technician from ITSS will have to install Node on your machine - get them to select the latest LTS version.)

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

### Development server

```bash
npm start
```

You can view the development server at `localhost:8080`.

To view report cards in development, change the reference to your JSON file in 'index.js' to 'students_fake.json', and the same thing for 'courses.json'. This file contains fake data in the correct format, with no SQL queries or PSHTML tags that only work within PowerSchool. 

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

Reports must then be content of each project's 'dist' folder can be added to a named folder for that report card in the pei_reportcards plugin.

Notes on diffs from original config: 
- I adjusted the config files to handle multi-page projects instead of single pages. Each page (handlebars template) needs to be added to the *pages* array in webpack.common.js using the same name as the template file.
- I removed Sass and PostCSS because they were introducing vulnerabilities and neither was going to be in use. 
- I removed Babel because all users are on managed evergreen versions of Chrome or Edge and can interpret ES6 code without transpiling.
- The linters are having a hard time with both Handlebars templates (mixed context) and PowerSchool DATs (tlist_sql especially), but I haven't had a chance to really investigate how we could possibly solve that
